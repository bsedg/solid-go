Solid implementation in Go

Solid is a specification that lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores called Pods. Pods are like secure personal web servers for data. When data is stored in someone's Pod, they control which people and applications can access it. 

The goal is to adhere to the Solid protocol https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol.
